		<p>This is the first website I ever made.</p>
		<p>I was teaching myself in Asia over the pandemic, spending hours a day without any real idea as to what I was doing. With that in mind I think it was fairly sucessful. I plan to come back to this someday.</p>

		<p>This was another, much more serious responsive layout project.</p>

		<p>Full disclosure: I was given a layout and wasn't allowed to change any of the HTML. I was meant to only edit this with CSS. It was a "Theme Challenge."</p>
