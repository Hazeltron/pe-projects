<p>hello?</p>

<h2>Date: Jul 19 2023</h2>
<p>Yesterday:</p>
<p>I was pretty stressed with getting everything ready for my trip. I went to work, thankfully got cut early and did laundry/cleaned the apartment, wrote a letter for the cat sitter, etc. Then I worked on programming exercises and nearly finished them.</p>
<p>Today:</p>
<p>I had weird dreams all night. In one of them, I was trying to maintain/design these two text documents, and if I changed anything one of them would break. I think my brain was trying to work out how PHP works as a new member of the code base I have.</p>
<p>I woke up today and for whatever reason the first thing I thought about was Legos. When I was a kid we had this huge box of random legos and you could make anything out of them--houses, cars, spaceships, statues, you name it. The hardest part was figuring out how to make the things you thought about and finding the parts.</p>
<p>So that's what PHP is to me.
It's a box of Legos without an instruction manual.</p>
<p>I still have to pack and get a few things together before tonight. I'm going to try to finish programming exercises before work and hopefully, at least start pseudo code at my brother's house in Denver.
Sorry, this is a bit long.</p>
