#Markdown PHP for Alpha-7

##Ad--General:

###Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p?

It was in >exercises-for-programers.
So not in e4p, but neither is mine. I must have missed the memo. Was it easy to find? Relitively. But you did have to search a bit. 

###How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?

Yes. It's clearly labeled. 

###Does it match the rest of the site?
Yes, but there is a slight jump to the right for whatever reason when transitioning from the home page to e4p. 

##Character counter:
###How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?

Umm... kind of. The title says character count and then it tells you to enter a "string." If I'm a normal person and not a nerd, I'm not going to know what a string is. So, it would be helpful to break it down for them. 

Also, if I'm a normal person, I'm going to think of characters as book characters or something like that, so that could be clearer. 

###Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?

They are legible for the most part. But, the orange-on-black button is hard to read and the text could use some space to breathe. The nav links are also orange (not what we're talking about but also hard to read.) 

###Does the form work with the expected input?

Yes. It does its job.

###Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?

Looks good. It counts spaces, but so does mine. Are spaces characters??

###Do things jump around when you interact with them?

No. 

###Is the outcome clear?

Yes.

###Do the form styles match across all forms?

As Joseph said, this was never explicitly stated as an objective. If it's on a site then, yeah, it should be by default but I didn't even know I was supposed to put this on my site. I think it should be stated earlier. Unless I just missed it. 

Anyway, no it isn't. The input area for the character counter is red with green text. The input area for the paint form is white with orange text.

###Is it a pleasure to use?

Yeah, it works fine. 

###What could be improved?

The title/wording used. It's too program-y and assumes the user understands what strings/characters are. Also, I'm not a fan of green text on a red background. 


##Paint Calculator: 

###How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?

Way better than the last one. I know exactly what's going on. Good humanist copy.

###Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?

Yes. No notes other than "inches" needs margin-top. 

###Does the form work with the expected input?

Yes. It does its job.

###Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?

It's pretty good. However, it does do wonky things like saying the square footage is 4.33333333333 feet. It would be better if iit rounded to a whole number.

###Do things jump around when you interact with them?

Yes. You press enter and it jumps to the top. 

###Is the outcome clear?

Yes.

###Do the form styles match across all forms?

See above.

###Is it a pleasure to use?

Yeah, it works fine. 

###What could be improved?

Rounding.
