##Ad--General:

###Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p?
It was in >exercises-for-programers.
So not in e4p, but neither is mine. I must have missed the memo. Was it easy to find? Relitively. But you did have to search a bit. 

###How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
Yes. It's clearly labeled. 

###Does it match the rest of the site?
Yes, but there is a slight jump to the right for whatever reason when transitioning from the home page to e4p. 

##Character counter:
###How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?

###Do things jump around when you interact with them?
###Is the outcome clear?
###Do the form styles match across all forms?
###Is it a pleasure to use?
