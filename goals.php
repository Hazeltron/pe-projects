        <h2 class="h2-tan">5 year</h2>
        <p>Honestly, I want to be sitting on a beach in Malaysia in five years.</p>
        <p>I want a remote programming and/or UX design job that pays me more than 100k a year. I want to own a sweet house, a nice motorbike, and be married to (or seriously dating) an awesome lady. I want that house to be ON the beach in a Southeast Asian country.</p>
        <p>When I fall asleep, I’m listening to the ocean and the foreign languages of fishermen chattering outside my window.</p>
        <p>I want a second house in the Colorado Rockies with a beautiful view of the mountains. It can be a cabin or a shitty house. I don’t care, as long as I own land with a structure on it.</p>
        <p>I also want to be happy and content.</p>
        <p>See this is where my plans break down because I need to interact with people in real life or I get depressed.</p>
        <p>So a remote job? Not great.</p> 
        <p>Living in Malaysia where I don’t know the language? Not great.</p> 
        <p>Being isolated in the Colorado Rockies? Not great.</p>
        <p>What do I actually want? Honestly, I just want to be good. Like never worry about money ever again, good. I do alright at Jax, but I’ve been broke before and that shit sucks.</p>
        <p>Anyone who says money can’t buy happiness is right but with the caveat: it makes it a lot easier to be.</p>
        <p>I think having money gives you options and I want to explore those options.</p>
        <p>Plus, what happens if I get cancer or the parachute rips and I fall, breaking every bone in my body? I would be so screwed. Those medical bills alone would flatline me.</p>
        <p>Wow. That was a tangent.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-tan">End of the course</h2>
        <p>By the end of the course I would like to be able to be handed a project, look at it and say “Bet. I can do this.” and ask a few follow-up questions and start working. I want that confidence and the skills to back it up.</p>
        <p>I want to be set up with a portfolio of work that will impress employers and some experience under my belt. I also want to understand what I’m doing, not just googling “how do I…”</p>
        <p>A little of that is fine but I better not be looking up “how to JavaScript?”</p>
        <p>Landing a job or high-paying jig is also paramount. I want to come out of this class with a W or Ws. Let’s just make that plural.</p>
        <p>What don’t I want to happen?</p>
        <p>I don’t want to come out of this with one skill. I’d like to be an asset and understand design and some code.</p>

            <h2>End of the Month</h2>
            <p>By the end of the month, I would like to feel confident with the basics of building a webpage. I’d also like it if I could produce something that looks and functions well.</p>
            <p>I want my personal webpages to stand out, be consistent and be visually appealing.</p>

            <p>By the end of the week, I would like to have all of the catchup work finished and be on track for next week. I want to understand all the concepts we’ve covered and feel confident in talking about them.</p>
