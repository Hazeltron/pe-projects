        "whyText": "Initially, these vacation cards were part of a resort website I was working on. We needed cards for experience packages. I had seen something similar to this when I was performing design research for the project. <br> This was my take on the idea, but unfortunately, the rounded corners didn’t match the overall website, so it had to be scrapped.",
        "diffText": "Making the initial card wasn’t a problem but finding a way to stretch the images across them was. Even when I figured out a way to do this, I was still left with the unfortunate truth that half the image would be obscured by the text box. <br> I dealt with this by dropping the opacity, but as you can see with the diver card, it failed to solve the issue.<br><br> Another unexpected problem occurred when I realized that adding more text would send the textbox past the card’s boundaries, causing the grid of cards to become unaligned.<br> I could have used ellipsis to solve this but that comes with its own issues.<br> In the end, I left it up to the marketing people to write concise content.",
        "howText": "<br> The cards themselves are being generated by a PHP loop that's pulling from a JSON file. They're being aligned and organized with CSS grid. The background images are being positioned using absolute positioning and object-fit.
