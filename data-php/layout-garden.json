I had seen something similar to this when I was performing design research for the project.", "This was my take on the idea, but unfortunately, the rounded corners didn’t match the overall website, so it had to be scrapped."

            "Making the initial card wasn’t a problem but finding a way to stretch the images across them was. Even when I figured out a way to do this, I was still left with the unfortunate truth that half the image would be obscured by the text box.",
            "I dealt with this by dropping the opacity, but as you can see with the diver card, it failed to solve the issue.",
            "Another unexpected problem occurred when I realized that adding more text would send the textbox past the card’s boundaries, causing the grid of cards to become unaligned.",
            "I could have used ellipsis to solve this but that comes with its own issues.",
