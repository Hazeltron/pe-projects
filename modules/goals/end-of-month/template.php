 <h2>End of the Month</h2>

        <p>By the end of the month, I would like to feel confident with PHP, structuring a website, and quicker with key shortcuts. Iâ€™d also like to be caught up in the course.</p>

        <p>I want my personal webpages to stand out, be consistent and be visually appealing.</p>
