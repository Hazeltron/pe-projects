<h2>5 year</h2>

        <p>Honestly, I want to be sitting on a beach in Malaysia in five years.</p>

        <p>I want a remote programming and/or UX design job that pays me more than 100k a year. I want to own a sweet house, a nice motorbike, and be married to (or seriously dating) an awesome lady. I want that house to be ON the beach in a Southeast Asian country.</p>

        <p>When I fall asleep, I’m listening to the ocean and the foreign languages of fishermen chattering outside my window.</p>

        <p>I want a second house in the Colorado Rockies with a beautiful view of the mountains. It can be a cabin or a shitty house. I don’t care, as long as I own land with a structure on it.</p>

        <p>I also want to be happy and content.</p>

        <p>See this is where my plans break down because I need to interact with people in real life or I get depressed.</p>

        <p>So a remote job? Not great.</p>

        <p>Living in Malaysia where I don’t know the language? Not great.</p> 

        <p>Being isolated in the Colorado Rockies? Not great.</p>

        <p>What do I actually want? Honestly, I just want to be good. Like never worry about money ever again, good. I do alright at Jax, but I’ve been broke before and that shit sucks.</p>

        <p>Anyone who says money can’t buy happiness is right but with the caveat: it makes it a lot easier to be.</p>

        <p>I think having money gives you options and I want to explore those options.</p>

        <p>Plus, what happens if I get cancer or the parachute rips and I fall, breaking every bone in my body? I would be so screwed. Those medical bills alone would flatline me.</p>

        <p>Wow. That was a tangent.</p>
