<h2>End of the course</h2>

<p>By the end of the course I would like to be able to be handed a project, look at it and say “Bet. I can do this.” and ask a few follow-up questions and start working. I want that confidence and the skills to back it up.</p>

<p>I want to be set up with a portfolio of work that will impress employers and some experience under my belt. I also want to understand what I’m doing, not just googling “how do I…”</p>

<p>A little of that is fine but I better not be looking up “how to JavaScript?”</p>

<p>Landing a job or high-paying jig is also paramount.</p>

<p>What don’t I want to happen?</p>

<p>I don’t want to come out of this with one skill. I’d like to be an asset and understand design and code.</p>
